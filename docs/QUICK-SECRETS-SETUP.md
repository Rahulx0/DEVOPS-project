## ‚úÖ After Adding Secrets

1. All 5 secrets should be listed in GitHub Settings
2. Make a small commit to trigger the workflow:
   ```bash
   echo "# Testing CI" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "test: Trigger GitHub Actions"
   git push origin rahul
   ```

3. Check the workflow run:
   - Go to: https://github.com/Rahulx0/DEVOPS-project/actions
   - You should see a new workflow run

## üö® Important Notes

- **Never commit AWS credentials to git**
- The secrets are encrypted and only visible to GitHub Actions
- If workflow fails, check the Actions tab for error logs
- The full setup guide is in `docs/github-actions-setup.md`

---

## üêõ If You Don't Have IAM Permissions

You may need to create a dedicated IAM user. See the full guide:
`docs/github-actions-setup.md` - Step 1

Or ask your AWS administrator to:
1. Create IAM user: `github-actions-urbangear`
2. Attach policies: `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryPowerUser`, `AmazonEKSClusterPolicy`
3. Generate access keys
4. Share the access key ID and secret with you
